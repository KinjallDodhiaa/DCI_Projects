Exercise 1:

- Make a simple HTML form with two inputs (sameprice, discount) and add an HTML button to it. Give this button an onClick event handler. 
When the button is clicked it should multiply gamePrice by discount and present a new window (e.g., a popup window) containing the phrase "$(result) off!". 
(You will need concatenation to achieve this.)
You may want to consider using JavaScript's built-in Maths object to round the number you get in your result to a more reasonable one.


Exercise 2:

Create a registration form with the following features:
1- your form must take common user information such as first name, family name, phone number, email, password, etc.
2- when a user focuses on each input the background color of that input must turn to yellow.
3- You need to control the first name and family name are shown with capital letters. 
4- Check the email and phone numbers with regex to make sure they are entered in the right format.
5- Before a user can send her registration form, you must control the inputs in terms of emptiness.
